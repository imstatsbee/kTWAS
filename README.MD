## Usersâ€™ Manual of kTWAS (Version 1.0.0)
### Preamble

The kTWAS program leverages TWAS-like feature selection (Elastic Net weights) followed by a SKAT-like kernel-based score test, to combine advantages from both approaches.<br><br>

### Installation
kTWAS is a batteries-included JAR executable. All needed external jar packages are included in the downloadable, kTWAS.jar. To download all necessary files, users can use the command 
`git clone https://github.com/theLongLab/kTWAS.git`
As we used an R package SKAT, the users have to install R and SKAT (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SKAT/index.html.) The versions of R and R package SKAT that we have used on our platform are: version 2.0.0 for SKAT and version 3.5.1 for R. Other versions are not tested, although they may work. Users are also expected to have java (version: 1.8) on their platform. plink (v1.07, https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/download.shtml) should also be installed.

Usage:

`java -jar PoolHapX.jar kTWAS -format csv|plink -input_genotype INPUT_GENOTYPE_FILE -input_phenotype INPUT_PHENOTYPE_FILE -input_phenotype_column INPUT_PHENOTYPE_COLUMN_START:2 -input_phenotype_type PHENOTYPE_TYPE: continuous|binary 
-en_info_path INPUT_ELASTICNET_INFORMATION_FILE  -gene INPUT_ENSEMBL_GENE_ID  -plink PLINK_BINARY_FILE_PATH  -Rscript RSCRIPT_BINARY_FILE_PATH -output_folder OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH`

Installation and a simple example are described below. Users can get the final p-value result under the folder: OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH. 

You may try our example after "git clone". If trying csv format, the command line is:

`java -jar kTWAS.jar kTWAS -format csv -input_genotype EXAMPLE/CSV_FORMAT/example.csv -input_phenotype EXAMPLE/CSV_FORMAT/example.tsv -input_phenotype_column 2 -input_phenotype_type binary -en_info_path ElasticNet_DB/ElasticNet_Whole_Blood.txt -gene ENSG00000250334.5 -plink /PATH/TO/plink -Rscript /PATH/TO/Rscript -output_folder /PATH/TO/OUT_FOLDER`

Otherwise, if users want to try plink format, the command line is:

`java -jar kTWAS.jar kTWAS -format plink -input_genotype EXAMPLE/PLINK_FORMAT/example.tped -input_phenotype EXAMPLE/PLINK_FORMAT/example.tfam -input_phenotype_column 6 -input_phenotype_type binary -en_info_path ElasticNet_DB/ElasticNet_Whole_Blood.txt -gene ENSG00000250334.5 -plink /PATH/TO/plink -Rscript /PATH/TO/Rscript -output_folder /PATH/TO/OUT_FOLDER`

Please note that, to consistent with plink format, the phenotype is set to missing (normally represented by -9) if unspecified. It must be a numeric value. Case/control phenotypes are normally coded as control = 1, case = 2.The kTWAS.result under /PATH/TO/OUT_FOLDER is the final output file by kTWAS. More description and benchmarking of kTWAS can be found in our publication:https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.177121v1.full.pdf
